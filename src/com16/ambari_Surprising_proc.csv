The queuedthread pool size is 25.Somehow the http connections are being torn down from the UI side but the server still is hanging onto that socket and reading (most likely UI will also need to close http connections if its not using them - which might be an issue as well but doesnt have to addressed as urgent). The server has a read timeout of 0 which means it will just hang on to that socket for read. This causes all the threads to block at one time or the other.

Easy way to check that is to call Ambari server API's and also bring up a new browser window (new instance) and try hitting the browser UI., api api handl queuedthreadpool queuedthreadpool queuedthread pool size somehow somehow http connect torn UI side server still hang onto socket read like UI also need close http connect not use might issu well doesnt address urgent urgent server read timeout mean hang socket read read caus thread block one time simpl solut add read timeout SelectChannelConnector select channel connector SslSelectChannelConnector ssl select channel connector use except use except trace trace SEVERE SEVERE except contain within MappableContainerException mappabl contain except could not map respons throw throw HTTP containerorg eclips jetti io EofException containerorg eclips jetti io eof except earli EOF org eclips jetti server HttpInput read HttpInput java org eclips jetti server http input read http input java org codehau jackson impl ByteSourceBootstrapper ensureLoaded ByteSourceBootstrapper java org codehau jackson impl byte sourc bootstrapp ensur load byte sourc bootstrapp java org codehau jackson impl ByteSourceBootstrapper detectEncoding ByteSourceBootstrapper java org codehau jackson impl byte sourc bootstrapp detect encod byte sourc bootstrapp java org codehau jackson impl ByteSourceBootstrapper constructParser ByteSourceBootstrapper java org codehau jackson impl byte sourc bootstrapp construct parser byte sourc bootstrapp java org codehau jackson JsonFactory _createJsonParser JsonFactory java org codehau jackson json factori _create json parser json factori java org codehau jackson JsonFactory createJsonParser JsonFactory java org codehau jackson json factori creat json parser json factori java org codehau jackson jaxr JacksonJsonProvider readFrom JacksonJsonProvider java org codehau jackson jaxr jackson json provid read jackson json provid java com sun jersey json impl provid entiti JacksonProviderProxy readFrom JacksonProviderProxy java com sun jersey json impl provid entiti jackson provid proxi read jackson provid proxi java com sun jersey spi contain ContainerRequest getEntity ContainerRequest java notic com sun jersey spi contain contain request get entiti contain request java notic API API call time mean probalbi browser run long time time might possibilil browser might issu run long time time someth keep mind happen easi way check call ambari server API API also bring new browser window new instanc instanc tri hit browser UI UI,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In Oracle context  this could be the SID or SERVICE NAME  but it's not clear what this is.As a solution to all of the above  we will construct the JDBC URL based on the database type  host  and name for Hive/Oozie and present it to the user as an editable text field during install.Post-install  the JDBC URL remains editable  but does not change automatically as changes other database-related parameters., ran issu set hive oozi oracl databas databas hard code hard code port JDBC URL URL two type JDBC URLs UR Ls oracl oracl jdbc oracl thin HOST PORT SID jdbc oracl thin HOST PORT SID jdbc oracl thin HOST PORT SERVICEWe jdbc oracl thin HOST PORT SERVICE make assumpt latter may not work depend oracl set prompt databas databas name name oracl context could SID SERVICE NAME not clear solut construct JDBC URL base databas type host name hive oozi hive oozi present user edit text field instal post instal instal post instal JDBC URL remain edit not chang automat chang databas relat databas relat paramet paramet,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

So instead of getting M tasks we only get N tasks that too N oldest tasks which are returned. As a result the call never returns that latest request/tasks. The fix is to drop the filter done by the calls findByRequestIds and findByRequestAndTaskIds. Filter should only be applied on the number of requests to be returned., issu follow getRequestsByTaskStatus follow get request task statu behav correctli return latest request request note request gt gt gt gt task task call findByRequestIds find request id get oldest task requestId request Id task belong list return first call call instead get task get task oldest task return return result call never return latest request task request task fix drop filter done call findByRequestIds find request id findByRequestAndTaskIds find request task id filter appli number request return return,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Other properties related to NameNode RPC may have changed. We need to update the mapping accordingly., ambari UI show properti like NameNode name node RPC time time use get metric queri NameNode name node compon RpcQueueTime_avg_time howev rpc queue Time_avg_time howev hadoop look like properti name chang RpcQueueTimeAvgTime rpc queue time avg time ambari API no longer contain metric metric properti relat NameNode name node RPC may chang chang need updat map accordingli accordingli,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

All the cluster nodes are built on centos 6.0.During the ambari server installation  ambari-server recognized the primary/cluster os as redhat6 (see ambari.properties). During the ambari agent bootstrap/host register  ambari-agent regonized the agent os as centos linux6 (see log). From log files (ambari-server.log  ambari-agent.log)  I found the inconsistence caused the warning of ambari-agent bootstrapping and failure of host registering.I'm still not sure why this happen  but I guess it's caused by the differene of os checking methods among ambari server side code  ambari-agent bootstrap script (os_type_check.sh based on os release file) and registering script (Controller.py/Register.py based on os hardware profile) .I just share to see if anyone can fix the issue.BTW  for me  to solve the problem  I manually edited the script files to make it work temporarily:To avoid warning of agent bootstrapping  in os_type_check.sh  add current_os=$RH6 above the echo line or add res=0 after case statement;To make the node register work  in Controller.py  add data=data.replace('centos linux' 'redhat') before sending registering request;Thanks., use ambari hadoop cluster instal manag manag cluster node built cento ambari server instal ambari server ambari server recogn primari cluster primari cluster os redhat redhat see ambari properti ambari properti ambari agent bootstrap host bootstrap host regist ambari agent ambari agent regon agent os cento linux linux see log log log file ambari server log ambari server log ambari agent log ambari agent log found inconsist caus warn ambari agent ambari agent bootstrap failur host regist regist still not sure happen guess caus differen os check method among ambari server side code ambari agent ambari agent bootstrap script os_type_check sh os_type_check sh base os releas file file regist script control py regist py control py regist py base os hardwar profil profil share see anyon fix issu BTW issu BTW solv problem manual edit script file make work temporarili temporarili avoid warn agent bootstrap os_type_check sh os_type_check sh add current_os RH current_os RH echo line add re re case statement statement make node regist work control py control py add data data replac cento data data replac cento linux linux redhat redhat send regist request thank request thank,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Not ideal but better than creating an ambarirca database in this script (a user would be surprised to see this).2) Alternatively  we need to split out RCA DDL from the core Ambari. We can doc that if you plan to use HDP 1.3.x stack that you need to to setup an RCA database (since RCA is only applicable to those with HDP 1.3.x stack). If we go this route  for consistency  we would need to do the same for the oracle DDL.Note: Right now  looks like the oracle DDL just puts the RCA tables in the same database as ambari core tables (basically #1 above)., ambari DDL MySQL CREATE sql ambari DDL SQL CREATE sql includ creat ambarirca ambarirca databas CREATE databas CREATE DATABASE ambarirca USE ambarirca USE ambarirca ambarirca minimum DDL not creat ambarirca databas instead mix RCA tabl core ambari tabl oracl DDL think think not ideal better creat ambarirca databas script user would surpris see altern need split RCA DDL core ambari ambari doc plan use HDP stack need setup RCA databas sinc RCA applic HDP stack stack go rout consist would need oracl DDL note DDL note right look like oracl DDL put RCA tabl databas ambari core tabl basic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

5103,Oleg Nechiporenko,ambari-web,0,Maintenance Mode: maintenance icon changes on Host Details page, mainten mode mode mainten icon chang host detail page,For host components whose service is in maintenance mode  the maintenance mode icon should be displayed to the right of the service name and we should display the host component health (green / red  etc) on the far left.When the host itself is in maintenance mode  we should not show any maintenance mode icon on the host component (unless the service is in maintenance mode). This allows the UI to distinguish which host components are in service-derived maintenance mode vs host-derived. Also  on this page  host-level operations apply to all but the host components in service-derived maintenance mode (regardless of the host maintenance mode)  so this display is more natural and easier to understand for the end user., host compon whose servic mainten mode mainten mode icon display right servic name display host compon health green red etc etc far left left host mainten mode not show mainten mode icon host compon unless servic mainten mode mode allow UI distinguish host compon servic deriv servic deriv mainten mode vs host deriv host deriv also page host level host level oper appli host compon servic deriv servic deriv mainten mode regardless host mainten mode mode display natur easier understand end user user,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Say host3 is in maintenance mode.Rolling Restart dialog should say '1 NodeManager in maintenance mode will not be restarted'., fix issu would display slave whose host host host mainten mode skip skip exampl host host host host host host host NodeManager node manag instal say host host mainten mode roll mode roll restart dialog say NodeManager node manag mainten mode not restart restart,0,0,0,0,0,ambari-web/app/views/common/rolling_restart_view.js;,0

5628,Srimanth Gunturi,ambari-web,0,Explicitly disabling datanucleus l2 cache for hive, explicitli disabl datanucleu cach hive,Ambari installations of hive currently do not set any datanucleus related properties. There is such a thing as a datanucleus l2 cache  that is pretty bad for hive in a distributed environment if it is set. (If there is a lone embedded hive instance  with no other codepaths to the db  then it's fine  but that never happens in a distributed environment.)By default  if no setting is present  datanucleus defaults the l2 cache to being on  so hive ups the ante by defaulting to turning it off by default if no other setting is configured.Now  in a war of 'defaults'  the hive default should win  but this is an area where we have had recurring support issues from clients that turn it on expecting improved performance. Thus  I'd like ambari installed hive-site.xml to explicitly have this config parameter turned off  with a comment asking users to not switch it on as it impacts hive negatively.The parameter in question is 'datanucleus.cache.level2.type'   and it's value should be 'none'. (Note that I've seen some older configs that seem to do things like turning datanucleus.cache.level2 = false and stuff like that  that is bogus config and does nothing and should not be assumed to be a catch-all enabler.)As a comment  I'd like the following comment 'Disables datanucleus l2 cache. This must be set to 'none' for hive to work properly' or something to that effect., ambari instal hive current not set datanucleu relat properti properti thing datanucleu cach pretti bad hive distribut environ set set lone embed hive instanc no codepath db fine never happen distribut environ environ default no set present datanucleu default cach hive up ant default turn default no set configur configur war default default hive default win area recur support issu client turn expect improv perform perform thu like ambari instal hive site xml hive site xml explicitli config paramet turn comment ask user not switch impact hive neg neg paramet question datanucleu cach level type datanucleu cach level type valu none none note note seen older config seem thing like turn datanucleu cach level datanucleu cach level fals stuff like bogu config noth not assum catch catch enabl enabl comment like follow comment disabl disabl datanucleu cach cach must set none none hive work properli properli someth effect effect,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Even the simple logic ones fail. There are only 5 alert targets ever created  yet there are 9 returned sometimes. I'm wondering if this is because we tried to load some data in the @BeforeClass instead of @Before - maybe there's a weird Guice/JUnit race condition going on.I can't say I can fix this with confidence since I can't reproduce it.
