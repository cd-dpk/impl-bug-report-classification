The queuedthread pool size is 25.Somehow the http connections are being torn down from the UI side but the server still is hanging onto that socket and reading (most likely UI will also need to close http connections if its not using them - which might be an issue as well but doesnt have to addressed as urgent). The server has a read timeout of 0 which means it will just hang on to that socket for read. This causes all the threads to block at one time or the other. Simple solution is add read timeouts to all the SelectChannelConnector and SslSelectChannelConnector we use.Exception trace: SEVERE: The exception contained within MappableContainerException could not be mapped to a response  re-throwing to the HTTP containerorg.eclipse.jetty.io.EofException: early EOF at org.eclipse.jetty.server.HttpInput.read(HttpInput.java:65) at org.codehaus.jackson.impl.ByteSourceBootstrapper.ensureLoaded(ByteSourceBootstrapper.java:507) at org.codehaus.jackson.impl.ByteSourceBootstrapper.detectEncoding(ByteSourceBootstrapper.java:129) at org.codehaus.jackson.impl.ByteSourceBootstrapper.constructParser(ByteSourceBootstrapper.java:224) at org.codehaus.jackson.JsonFactory._createJsonParser(JsonFactory.java:785) at org.codehaus.jackson.JsonFactory.createJsonParser(JsonFactory.java:561) at org.codehaus.jackson.jaxrs.JacksonJsonProvider.readFrom(JacksonJsonProvider.java:414) at com.sun.jersey.json.impl.provider.entity.JacksonProviderProxy.readFrom(JacksonProviderProxy.java:139) at com.sun.jersey.spi.container.ContainerRequest.getEntity(ContainerRequest.java:474)Notice the API's is being called all the time - meaning they probalby had a browser up and running for a long time.There might be a possibilility that the browser might have some issues after running for a long time.

2192,ambari-agent,Nate Cole,Agent heartbeat lost during install,Agent heartbeat can become lost during install. The underlying issue is that during install  various yum commands are executed for component installation. However  the heartbeat ALSO performs a 'yum -C repolist'. If that command is taking a long time  the yum process can become deadlocked. The results of the repolist'ing are not used at this time  so remove it until needed.,1.2.3,1.2.4,61,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,

So instead of getting M tasks we only get N tasks that too N oldest tasks which are returned. As a result the call never returns that latest request/tasks. The fix is to drop the filter done by the calls findByRequestIds and findByRequestAndTaskIds. Filter should only be applied on the number of requests to be returned.,1.2.5,1.2.5,102,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,

The error thrown is 'could not connect to database' [it appears to drop the 'existing' databaseand you are required to start MySQL on the machine and create the database]BUSINESS IMPACT: This will affect all customers who choose an existing MySQL database for oozie and a new MySQL DB for hive when installing a cluster using AmbariSTEPS TO REPRODUCE: Choose an exisiting oozie MySQL database and point Ambari at this  and select a new Hive MySQL database on the installation optionsACTUAL BEHAVIOR: It seems that it drops the exisiting oozie database and then fails with an errot of could not connect (This is due to MySQL being down  but also the Oozie database is not there anymore)After starting MySQL and creating the database then the installer can continue from where it left off.EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: The installer should not stop MySQL and drop the oozie database if you select create a new Hive database and exisiting MySQL database for oozie.SUPPORT ANALYSIS: Reproduced in the lab in HDP 1.3.2 by following the steps above.,1.2.4,1.4.1,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,

All the cluster nodes are built on centos 6.0.During the ambari server installation  ambari-server recognized the primary/cluster os as redhat6 (see ambari.properties). During the ambari agent bootstrap/host register  ambari-agent regonized the agent os as centos linux6 (see log). From log files (ambari-server.log  ambari-agent.log)  I found the inconsistence caused the warning of ambari-agent bootstrapping and failure of host registering.I'm still not sure why this happen  but I guess it's caused by the differene of os checking methods among ambari server side code  ambari-agent bootstrap script (os_type_check.sh based on os release file) and registering script (Controller.py/Register.py based on os hardware profile) .I just share to see if anyone can fix the issue.BTW  for me  to solve the problem  I manually edited the script files to make it work temporarily:To avoid warning of agent bootstrapping  in os_type_check.sh  add current_os=$RH6 above the echo line or add res=0 after case statement;To make the node register work  in Controller.py  add data=data.replace('centos linux' 'redhat') before sending registering request;Thanks.,1.4.3,1.5.1,170,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Not ideal but better than creating an ambarirca database in this script (a user would be surprised to see this).2) Alternatively  we need to split out RCA DDL from the core Ambari. We can doc that if you plan to use HDP 1.3.x stack that you need to to setup an RCA database (since RCA is only applicable to those with HDP 1.3.x stack). If we go this route  for consistency  we would need to do the same for the oracle DDL.Note: Right now  looks like the oracle DDL just puts the RCA tables in the same database as ambari core tables (basically #1 above).,1.5.0,1.5.0,151,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,

5628,ambari-web,Srimanth Gunturi,Explicitly disabling datanucleus l2 cache for hive,Ambari installations of hive currently do not set any datanucleus related properties. There is such a thing as a datanucleus l2 cache  that is pretty bad for hive in a distributed environment if it is set. (If there is a lone embedded hive instance  with no other codepaths to the db  then it's fine  but that never happens in a distributed environment.)By default  if no setting is present  datanucleus defaults the l2 cache to being on  so hive ups the ante by defaulting to turning it off by default if no other setting is configured.Now  in a war of 'defaults'  the hive default should win  but this is an area where we have had recurring support issues from clients that turn it on expecting improved performance. Thus  I'd like ambari installed hive-site.xml to explicitly have this config parameter turned off  with a comment asking users to not switch it on as it impacts hive negatively.The parameter in question is 'datanucleus.cache.level2.type'   and it's value should be 'none'. (Note that I've seen some older configs that seem to do things like turning datanucleus.cache.level2 = false and stuff like that  that is bogus config and does nothing and should not be assumed to be a catch-all enabler.)As a comment  I'd like the following comment 'Disables datanucleus l2 cache. This must be set to 'none' for hive to work properly' or something to that effect.,1.5.1,1.6.1,232,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Either going to Filtered Hosts (2005) or All Hosts (2005)  select 'DataNodes &gt; Stop' A confirmation popup tells me that 50 DataNodes are about to be stopped. This should have been ~ 2000 DataNodes instead. 50 is the current page size on the Hosts page that I set.Another scenario: Set page size to 50. Select 100 hosts using 'check all'  'next page'  then 'check all' Go to 'Actions &gt; Selected Hosts &gt; DataNodes &gt; Stop'.

6471,ambari-web,Srimanth Gunturi,Add Services Wizard can corrupt config files unpredictably,Testing using the 1.6.1 RC bits (branch-1.6.1  hash=ffb702b252a8b979529864ec5579465a122060b5) revealed that Add Services can corrupt config files in an unpredictable manner.We have seen: adding Pig resulted in core-site dropping all existing properties except for 'hadoop.proxyuser.falcon.hosts and hadoop.proxyuser.falcon.groups' add Storm resulted in core-site retaining all existing properties but dropping hadoop.proxyuser.* settings for all services except Falcon adding Storm dropped a number of existing properties in yarn-site (and NodeManagers can no longer restart after that)The bottomline here is that behavior seems pretty random (adding the same service on different clusters results in different behavior).Also  when adding a service  certain configs (like hdfs-site) were not cloned while most other configs (like yarn-site  mapred-site) get cloned even if no property changes are made regardless of which service is added.Update: changes to hdfs-site during Add Services Wizard never persists.,1.6.1,1.6.1,133,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
